# P4 - miniBlab

## Description
**miniBlab:**  A simple chatroom app ala Chatroulette with minimalist design using Vue.js

## Intended User
Bored? I don't have a userbase but you can shout into the void until a userbase coalesces -- worked for the solar system on a long enough timeframe.

## Team
Myself as Dev and my cat, Paris, for moral support.

## Possible Roadblocks
1. Never used Vue.js
    * Learn and implement effectively depends on me grasping things quickly
    * Need a momentum boost? Literally a youtube tutorial existed for replacing parts of the exact model of my old 2005 Toyota Corolla so getting stuck somewhere is because I'm not looking **(bad)** or don't know what I'm looking for **(bad but understandable)**
2. Never used Socket io
    * Lots of documentation, it'll be fine just get caffienated. 
    * Repeat momentum boost step from above if needed.
3. Life's tough, get a helmet

## MVP
- [ ] Username input to differentiate chat participants
- [ ] Text input box + send button 
- [ ] Display chat window and chat history in appropriately sized content section
    - [ ] Chat history includes Username: Text
- [ ] Pretty because i ðŸ’– frontend way more

## Stretch Goals
- [ ] Mobile friendly
- [ ] SPA if possible because I love SPAs
- [ ] Register username for unique use
- [ ] Browseable history log of chatroom any time window is refreshed.
    - [ ] Maybe limit to 100 messages that can be retrieved
    - [ ] Might need to clear recent chat for historical messages each time 100+ messages retrieved.
- [ ] Allow images to be sent

## Tech Stack
* Vue.js
* Node.js
* Express
* Bootstrap for layout + Custom CSS
* BACKEND: MongoDB maybe? But Postgres will let me deploy to Heroku

## Deployment
* Netlify (love it) or Heroku (fussy but will host a postgres DB)
